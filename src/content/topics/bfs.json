Starting from a source node, BFS visits all neighbors at distance 1, then all neighbors at distance 2, and so on.\n\nThink of it as exploring a maze by checking all paths that are 1 step away, then all paths that are 2 steps away, systematically ensuring you find the shortest path to any reachable location.\n\n**Key characteristic**: BFS uses a **queue** (First-In-First-Out) to track which nodes to explore next, ensuring level-order traversal."

      "contentMarkdown": "✅ **Use BFS when:**\n- Finding the **shortest path** in an unweighted graph\n- Level-order traversal is needed\n- Exploring neighbors before going deeper\n- Finding all nodes within k distance\n- Solving puzzles with minimum moves (e.g., chess knight, word ladder)\n\n❌ **Don't use BFS when:**\n- Graph is very wide (many neighbors per node) - high memory usage\n- Depth-first exploration is more natural for the problem\n- Only need to check if path exists (DFS is simpler)"
